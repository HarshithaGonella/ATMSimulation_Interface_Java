<ATM Machine Simulation Interface>
Overview
Welcome to the ATM Machine Simulation Interface project! This Java-based application is designed to simulate the functionalities of an ATM, providing an interactive and educational experience for those interested in understanding core banking operations and software development.

Project Background
Developed as part of a training and internship program with Octanet Services, this project showcases practical skills in Java development. It highlights the ability to design and implement a user-friendly interface for an ATM system, simulating essential features such as account management, transaction processing, and security measures.

Features
Check Remaining Account Balance: Easily view the current balance of your account.
Withdraw and Deposit Funds: Perform transactions to withdraw or deposit money, with real-time updates to account balance.
Change PIN: Securely update your account PIN to enhance security.
Transaction History: View a detailed history of past transactions for transparency and record-keeping.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for application logic and interface design.
Swing: Java GUI toolkit used for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
JDBC: For potential future integrations with database systems.
